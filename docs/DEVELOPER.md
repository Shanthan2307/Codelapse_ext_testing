## 🎬 Quick Showcase: Live Full-Stack Demo Report

We have pre-generated a complete, self-contained standalone demo report showcasing a developer building a **Full-Stack Task Management app (React + Node.js Express + TypeScript)** from scratch to completion.

### How to View the Demo:
1. Double-click or open [`demo_showcase_report.html`](../demo_showcase_report.html) in any web browser (**Google Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox**).
2. **Watch the Code Timelapse**:
   - Press **`▶ Play`** or drag the timeline scrubber to watch the code write itself line by line.
   - Watch the active file tabs automatically switch between `server/src/index.ts`, `server/src/types.ts`, `client/src/App.tsx`, and `client/src/components/TaskCard.tsx`.
   - Click the milestone markers on the slider:
     - `✕` / `✓` **Test Run Failures & Fixes**
     - `⚛️` **React / Vite HMR Updates**
     - `🚀` **Node.js Express Server Startup**
     - `📦` **NPM Package Additions**
   - Check the **Top Metrics Row**, the **24-Bucket Activity Distribution**, and the **AI Summarizer (Conventional Commits & PR description)**!

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 📁 Folder-Scoped Recording
- **You choose what gets recorded**: nothing is recorded until you pick the folder you are working in, either an open workspace folder or any folder via **Browse** (e.g. one assignment inside a course folder). You can also right-click a folder in the Explorer and choose **CodeLapse: Choose Folder to Record**.
- **Only that folder**: edits to files outside it, and inside `.git` or `node_modules`, are ignored. Test/build runs from tasks or debug sessions that belong to another project are ignored too.
- **Clean project paths**: files are stored relative to the chosen folder (`src/App.tsx`), so the replay shows the project's own structure.
- **Remembered per workspace**: reopening VS Code resumes recording the same folder. The status bar always shows which folder is being recorded; switching folders saves the current session and starts a new one.

### 2. 🎥 60 FPS Interactive Timelapse Player
- **Smooth Typing Playback**: Instead of jumping between snapshots, the player diffs each snapshot against the previous version of the file (line-level LCS, trimmed to the exact changed characters) and animates the edit character by character, driven by `requestAnimationFrame`.
- **Skip Idle**: Gaps where nothing was typed are glided across in a fraction of a second, so playback time is spent on actual coding.
- **Scrubbable Timeline**: Time-based slider (the thumb lines up with run and milestone markers), snapshot stepping (`⏮️` / `⏭️`) and variable speeds (`1x`, `2x`, `5x`, `10x`).
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: `Space` play/pause, `←` / `→` previous/next snapshot, `Home` / `End` jump to start/end.
- **Exact Cursor & Selection Tracking**: Reconstructs typing cursor positions (`|`) and highlighted selection ranges in real-time.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Embedded PrismJS syntax engine supporting TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, CSS, JSON, HTML, etc.
- **Multi-File Workspace Awareness**: Automatically transitions between files as edits jump across the project.

### 3. 📊 24-Bucket Activity & Mini-Diff Heatmaps
- Slices the session duration into **24 proportional temporal buckets**.
- **Interactive Mini-Diff Hover**: Hover over any bucket to see the exact time slice, character volume, and a mini-diff preview of lines added (`+`) and removed (`-`).
- **Line Edit Heatmaps**: Algorithmic line diffing that highlights code churn and the most heavily modified lines.

### 4. 🧠 Framework-Specific Intelligence
- **⚛️ React / Next.js / Vite**:
  - Intercepts Vite HMR updates (`[vite] hmr update <file>`) and Next.js Fast Refresh compilation timings.
  - Detects React Hook additions (`useState`, `useEffect`, custom hooks) and catches runtime render errors.
- **🟢 Node.js / Express / NestJS**:
  - Tracks `nodemon`, `tsx watch`, and `node --watch` restart/exit lifecycles.
  - Automatically captures server listening ports (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`) and npm package installations.
- **🐍 Django / Python**:
  - Intercepts `makemigrations` and `migrate` database schema executions (`Applying <app>.<migration>... OK`).
  - Tracks Django `StatReloader` changes and system check passes.

> **Current limitation:** the terminal-output watchers above (HMR, nodemon, server ports, npm installs, migrations) rely on VS Code's *proposed* `terminalDataWriteEvent` API, which installed extensions are not allowed to use. Until they are moved to the stable shell-execution API, these milestones only appear in generated demo data. Test/build runs **are** recorded when launched as VS Code Tasks (**Terminal → Run Task…**) or debug sessions, and React hook usage is detected on save.

### 5. 🤖 AI Session Intelligence & Summarizer
- **Conventional Commit Generator**: Auto-generates structured messages (e.g. `feat(auth): ...` or `fix(jwt): ...`) based on net line counts and test results.
- **Markdown PR Description**: Produces ready-to-copy GitHub Pull Request summaries with modified file tables, test pass rates, and session highlights.
- **Daily Standup Report**: One-click summary formatted for Slack / Microsoft Teams.

### 6. 📥 Standalone Single-File HTML Exporter
- Export your session to a standalone `.html` file that embeds the entire React dashboard, PrismJS highlighter, styles, and replay dataset.
- Shareable with professors, teammates, and recruiters without requiring VS Code installed.

## 🏛️ Computer Science Architecture & Design

CodeLapse implements modern, industry-standard systems and software engineering patterns:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Write Pipeline (Zero-Latency Telemetry)"
        A[VS Code onDidChangeTextDocument] -->|Zero-Copy Deltas| B[DeltaEngine]
        B -->|I-Frame / Keyframe| C[Periodic Snapshot: 50 edits]

        H & I & J -->|Milestone Events| E
    end

    subgraph "Read / Replay Pipeline (CQRS)"

        K -->|IPC Bridge postMessage| L[React Webview Dashboard]
        L --> M[TimelapsePlayer: 60 FPS Replay]

        L --> O[AISummaryCard: Commits & PRs]
        L --> P[ReportExporter: Standalone HTML]
    end
```

### Core CS Paradigms:
1. **Event Sourcing & Delta Compression (\(O(N \cdot L) \to O(\Delta)\))**:
   - Instead of duplicating full file text strings on every keystroke, CodeLapse captures atomic `TextChange` deltas (`rangeOffset`, `rangeLength`, `text`).
   - Uses a **Keyframe (I-Frame)** every 50 edits and lightweight **Deltas (P-Frames)** in between, reducing storage footprint and memory by over **90%**.
2. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) & Append-Only Streaming (\(O(1)\) Non-Blocking IO)**:
   - Eliminates `JSON.stringify` event loop freezes by writing single lines to `session-<timestamp>.jsonl` using Node's `fs.createWriteStream`.
3. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**:
   - Decouples the ultra-lightweight write recorder from the heavy analytics and diffing engine.
4. **Strategy / Plugin Pattern**:
   - `FrameworkDetector` scans project manifests and dynamically attaches active framework watchers without monolithic bloat.

## 🧪 Test Suite

CodeLapse includes a comprehensive Mocha test suite covering core analytics, delta reconstruction, debouncing, framework watchers, and AI summarization:

```
  SessionSummarizer AI & Standup Intelligence Tests
    ✔ generates structured conventional commits and PR summaries from session data

  AnalyticsEngine Unit Tests
    ✔ accurately computes session duration
    ✔ accurately calculates net lines written across multiple files
    ✔ accurately computes total estimated keystrokes
    ✔ generates a 24-bucket activity array representing the session timeline
    ✔ calculates line edit heatmaps with accurate edit counts and intensity
    ✔ produces comprehensive session analytics summary

  DeltaEngine Keyframe & Delta Patching Tests
    ✔ applies simple atomic insertions and deletions correctly
    ✔ reconstructs file text accurately from a Keyframe + Delta sequence
    ✔ folds a live delta stream onto per-file baselines, not onto empty text
    ✔ materializes multi-file DeltaSnapshots into chronological full Snapshots

  DocumentTracker Debounce & Milestone Tests
    ✔ batches rapid keystrokes within 500ms into a single snapshot (82ms)
    ✔ independently tracks debouncing across distinct multi-file paths (61ms)
    ✔ triggers a large-delete SessionEvent when more than 50 characters are deleted (62ms)

  Framework Watchers Unit Tests
    ✔ ReactWatcher intercepts Vite and Next.js HMR compilation events
    ✔ NodeWatcher intercepts Nodemon restarts, package additions, and server ports
    ✔ DjangoWatcher intercepts migrations, system checks, and StatReloader reloads

  PlaybackModel Smooth Typing Interpolation Tests
    ✔ reproduces the target text exactly once all edits are applied
    ✔ survives randomized edit sequences (fuzz)
    ✔ only retypes the changed parts when two distant lines are edited
    ✔ never glues following code onto a line that is still being typed
    ✔ places the caret at the end of the text typed so far
    ✔ shows exact snapshots at their timestamps and typing in between
    ✔ keeps typing windows inside the gap before each snapshot
    ✔ reports idle spans so the player can skip them
    ✔ steps between snapshot boundaries

  Folder-Scoped Recording Path Tests
    ✔ accepts the folder itself and anything beneath it
    ✔ rejects parents, siblings, and look-alike sibling names
    ✔ honours case-insensitive file systems only when asked to
    ✔ detects overlapping folders in both directions
    ✔ produces forward-slash paths relative to the chosen folder
    ✔ ignores files inside .git and node_modules

  Standalone HTML Report Embedding Tests
    ✔ never lets recorded code close the surrounding <script> tag
    ✔ escapes HTML special characters in titles

  34 passing (252ms)
```

End-to-end tests (`npm run test:integration`) launch a real VS Code with a throwaway profile and a two-project workspace, make real edits, and verify what lands on disk:

```
  Folder-scoped recording (real VS Code)
    ✔ records nothing until a folder is chosen
    ✔ records only files inside the chosen folder, with folder-relative paths
    ✔ starts every new session with a keyframe so it replays from disk
    ✔ switching folders saves the old session and records only the new folder
    ✔ never writes absolute paths (or the username in them) into recordings
    ✔ saves chosen sessions as raw logs plus a working HTML report

  6 passing (10s)
```
